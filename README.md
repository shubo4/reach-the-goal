# reach-the-goal
Here I have created custom environment for a game. Used Deep Q learning to training the agent. We have also teste the model.

The goal of this game is to go from the starting state (P) to the goal state (+) by walking only on unobstructed path and avoid obstacles on the way (W). However, the road has a pit (-), so you have to avoid the pit at all costs (deterministic environment).
